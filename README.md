# Wishlist Bot for Telegram
Bot for creating and storing wishlists

## Getting started
For personal use go to https://t.me/wishlist_organizer_bot. All commands and instructions are here.

As usual (from 9 AM to 1 PM) it will be open, 
but when the laptop is charging, on which the bot is hosted - it will be stopped for maximum 1.5 hours. In such unlucky case, write to https://t.me/muhammaduss.

Feel free to use and change code. For that, follow this instruction:

1. Clone the repository (you can find HTTPS link on Code button)
2. Install Telebot library, run on terminal: ```pip install pyTelegramBotAPI```
3. Rename config.py to config_local.py
4. In config_local.py put your bot's token (you can obtain your own bot and token for it in https://t.me/BotFather)
5. For running bot on your machine run on terminal: ```python bot.py```

If you find good feature which can be added, you are welcome! You can fork the repository and do a pull request
